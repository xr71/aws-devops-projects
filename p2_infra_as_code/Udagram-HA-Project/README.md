# Deploying a High Availability Web App on AWS using Cloudformation

Your company is creating an Instagram clone called Udagram. Developers pushed the latest version of their code in a zip file located in a public S3 Bucket.

You have been tasked with deploying the application, along with the necessary supporting software into its matching infrastructure.

This needs to be done in an automated fashion so that the infrastructure can be discarded as soon as the testing team finishes their tests and gathers their results.

There will be two parts to this project:

- You'll first develop a diagram that you can present as part of your portfolio and as a visual aid to understand the CloudFormation script.
- The second part is to interpret the instructions as well as your own diagram and create a matching CloudFormation script.
